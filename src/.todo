Todo:
    ☐ Animate the upload progress bar with a smooth transition between progress values.
    ☐ Style the file upload button.
    ☐ Add regex to the file type check.
    ☐ Hide options on upload.
    ☐ Update file listing details when a file is uploaded or deleted.
    ☐ Add a file size limit to the upload form (currently set by the php/nginx max upload variable).
    ☐ Add folders and thumbnails.
    ☐ Store the file row element in memory so that it does not need to be queried and can be accessed easier. This will be necessary for when I will want to add a function for when files are updated as it would make the code neater, less repetitive, and could help with if files are updated elsewhere.

    ✔ Fix file listing (shows all files for all users). @done(21-06-02 07:31)
    ✔ Look for a better way to return the files, the current method is slow as it waits for all of the file data before being displayed. @done(21-06-02 08:11)
    ✔ Fix issue where newly uploaded files cannot be clicked. @done(21-11-17 00:28)
    ✔ Fix meta tags. @done(21-11-19 16:12)
    ✔ Add file sharing options instead of just private/public. Planned methods: private, access by user account, access by timeout link, public, (possibly access by domain name in the future). @done(21-11-20 21:42)
    ✔ Middle click to open a file in a new tab @done(21-11-20 21:42)
    ✔ Normal click on a file opens a preview window, if the file cannot be previewed then say it cannot be previewed in the previewer. Also add a link to view the file externally as well as download it. An easy solution is to use and IFrame with the view file page. @done(21-11-20 21:42)
    ✔ Remove the text transform on the file name for the view file page. @done(21-11-20 21:44)
